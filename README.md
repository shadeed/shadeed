## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ahmad, Digital Product Designer and Front-End Developer from Palestine. I enjoy working on large scale product design and front-end projects which involves solving complex design problems.

I have a business named [Uxable](https://www.uxabledesign.com/) that is specialized in user experience design and front development. In my free time, I write in-depth articles about CSS. I own three blogs:
- [www.ishadeed.com](http://ishadeed.com/)
- [www.rtlstyling.com](http://rtlstyling.com/)
- [www.a11ymatters.com](https://www.a11ymatters.com/)

ðŸ“˜ I wrote an ebook about [Debugging CSS](http://debuggingcss.com/). Check it out and let me know what do you think!
